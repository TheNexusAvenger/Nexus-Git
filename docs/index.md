# Nexus Git
Nexus Git provides access to Git repositories in Roblox Studio.
It uses existing project structures (like Rojo) to allow developers
who don't use external editors to contribute to Git-based repositories.

## Currently Supported Project Structures
As part of Alpha release 0.1.0, Rojo 0.4 is the only project supported.
For the second release, Rojo 0.5 and newer will be supported. For other
project structures, please make GitHub issues for requesting support.
