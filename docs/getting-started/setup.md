# Setup

## Server
Nexus Git is currently not set up with any
package manager, so the only way to get the server
is to [download the executable from the GitHub releases](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Git/releases)
or [building it in your system](../building.md).
Optionally, it can be added to your system
path variable to make starting it faster.
```bash
> cd directory/with/project
> nexusgit serve
Serving on port 8000 using Rojo 0.5
```

## Client
Nexus Git has been removed from the 
Roblox plugin marketplace due to the project
being suspended. 
See the
[building instructions for the client](../building.md)
for building the plugin, or use the model file
as part of releases V.0.2.0 and newer.
