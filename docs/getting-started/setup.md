# Setup

## Server
Nexus Git is currently not set up with any
package manager, so the only way to get the server
is to [download the executable from the GitHub releases](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Git/releases)
or [building it in your system](../building.md).
Optionally, it can be added to your system
path variable to make starting it faster.
```bash
> cd directory/with/project
> nexusgit serve
Serving on port 8000 using Rojo 0.5
```

## Client
Nexus Git can be purchased from the
[Roblox plugin marketplace](https://www.roblox.com/library/4520145491/Nexus-Git-V-0-1-0-Alpha).
If the cost is too much or you want to
try it without buying it, see the
[building instructions for the client](../building.md).
Purchasing it helps justify development,
but it is understandable if you don't want
to pay for it. It is also useful if you want
to contibute to the project.
