It uses existing project structures (like Rojo) to allow developers who don't use external editors to contribute to Git-based repositories. Currently Supported Project Structures Rojo 0.4 and Rojo 0.5 are supported with this plugin for syncing into Roblox Studio and syncing out of Roblox Studio. Additional projects can be supported, but Rojo should be considered for new projects due to the robustness of the tool and the support it has given from several developers. Utility for Rojo Users If you are an existing Rojo user, Nexus Git can still be useful since syncing is two-way instead of one-way. Rojo two-way syncing is planned , but is not out yet. While not completely useful for scripts, exporting models is time consuming with stock Rojo. Additionally, Nexus Git supports both Rojo 0.4 and Rojo 0.5, which can be useful if you need to quickly import a Rojo 0.4 project into Roblox Studio, or export either Rojo 0.4 or Rojo 0.5. Limitation: No RBXM Support RBXM are Roblox model files that are stored as binary data. Support for these files is not planned unless an external library written for .NET Standard or .NET Core is made and maintained similar to rbx-dom in Rust . Warning: Alpha Release Nexus Git is current in an Alpha state. The overview of known limitations includes that will be resolved: - Linux and macOS currently have builds but have not been tested ( Trello card 1 , Trello card 2 ) - Git Branches aren't supported ( Trello card ) - Git Submodules aren't supported ( Trello card ) - Deleted files aren't clear ( Trello card ) - The client-side API dump is not up to date ( Trello card ) - RMXMX is current not supported ( Trello card ) - Code coverages is <40% on the server, and worse on the client ( Trello card ) These will be addressed in version 0.2.0. Due to blockers that prevent it from being updated, it will be several months before the next feature release. Major bugs will be fixed as minor releases if they come up.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#nexus-git","text":"Nexus Git provides access to Git repositories in Roblox Studio.

For building both the client and the server, you will need to clone the repository. To your file system. This can be done with the following: $ git clone https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Git For building the client, you will need to have Rojo for syncing files into Roblox Studio, or Nexus Git already installed. For building the server, you will need .NET Core SDK for the platform you are running. Version 3.0 or higher is required with how it is set up. Optionally, Python can be installed for running the script that compiles platform-specific builds of Nexus Git and copies them to a central repository. Building the Client The Nexus Git Client (plugin for Roblox Studio) is avaliable for purchase from the Roblox Plugin Marketplace, but can also be build from the repository. Open a Roblox Studio session an enable the HttpService. Whether using Rojo or Nexus Git, both require using the HttpService to communicate with the client. Using Rojo Enable Rojo by starting it in the command line. $ rojo serve Sync into Roblox Studio using either a one-time sync in or contionous syncing using the Rojo Roblox Studio plugin. In Roblox Studio, right click on the root ModuleScript named NexusGit in ServerStorage and either save it as a model file or as a local plugin. It should be saved to your Roblox/plugins directory. If it doesn't exist, create the directory. The specific path is platform and install specific, but for a default Winodws install, it is %localappdata%/Roblox/plugins . Using Nexus Git Enable Nexus Git by starting it in the command line. $ nexusgit serve Sync into Roblox Studio using either a local pull Nexus Git Roblox Studio plugin. In Roblox Studio, right click on the root ModuleScript named NexusGit in ServerStorage and either save it as a model file or as a local plugin. It should be saved to your Roblox/plugins directory. If it doesn't exist, create the directory. The specific path is platform and install specific, but for a default Winodws install, it is %localappdata%/Roblox/plugins . Building the Server Having .NET Core installed is required, but Python is optional. For this, there is 2 options to build. With Python In the server directory, there is a script that generates and moves the platform-exclusive executables to a single directory. The script can be run with the following: $ python server / Publisher . py compiler [ platform ] Using a normal install with the path variables correct, the supported platforms can be generated into server/bin with teh following: $ python server/Publisher.py dotnet If you don't have dotnet as a path variable, you can specify the full path. For a normal Windows install, it would look like this. $ python server/Publisher.py C:/Program \\ Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe In case you need a specific platform, the platform can be specified. The platforms supported by .NET Core in corefx/runtime.json in the .NET Core repository. As an example, compiling for ARM 64-bit on Windows (not tested for by Nexus Git) can be done with the following: $ python server/Publisher.py dotnet win-arm64 Without Python .NET Core's method for creating platform-specific executables is known as \"publishing\". When publishing in .NET Core, it does the following: - Gets the packages from NuGet. - Compiles the program. - Packages it into an executable. - .NET Core 3.0 is used because packaging into a single executable was added. To publish the executable, the following command is used: dotnet publish - r [ platform ] - c Release server / NexusGit . sln Using the example above for ARM 64-bit on Windows, the command is the following: dotnet publish - r win - arm64 - c Release server / NexusGit . sln After running the command, the platform executable can be found in server/NexusGit/bin/Release/NET_CORE_VERSION/PLATFORM/publish . If .NET Core 3.0 or newer is used, there will be an executable and a .pdb file. Only the executable is needed.","title":"Building"},{"location":"building/#building","text":"","title":"Building"},{"location":"building/#prerequisites","text":"Before starting, you should be familiar with Git and already have it installed.
