# Nexus-Git
Nexus Git provides access to Git repositories in Roblox Studio.
It uses existing project structures (like Rojo) to allow developers
who don't use external editors to contribute to Git-based repositories.

## Documentation
Documentation for the server and the client (Roblox Studio Plugin) can be found
on the [GitHub pages](https://thenexusavenger.github.io/Nexus-Git)
for this project. The [docs folder](docs) can also be used since it has all
of the markdown files.

## Building
The server is provided as releases for Windows x86-64, OS X x86-64,
and Linux x86-64 under the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Git/releases)
and the client is sold as a Roblox Studio plugin. If you need to
build either, whether it is to try the plugin or build for a different
platform (like Windows x86, Linux ARM, etc), see the 
[building documentation](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Git/blob/master/docs/building.md).

## Contributing
Both issues and pull requests are accepted for this project.
More information can be found [here](docs/contributing.md).

## Alternatives
Nexus Git doesn't have any major alternatives for handling exporting
files from Roblox Studio to the file system. Although, an
alternative workflow exists of using external editors and syncing
into Roblox Studio. See [Rojo's repository](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/)
for more information about this, as well as alternatives
to Rojo.
